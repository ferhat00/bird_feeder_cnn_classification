# bird_feeder_cnn_classification
A CNN used to classify images from a birdfeeder on the presence of birds.
This is a short exercise to classify whether birds are at your bird feeder using Keras, with Tensorflow as the backend.

I will show an example of a self trained deep learning model which utilises 2D convolutional neural networks to predict whether the image is a bird or not a bird. Using an Nvidia GTX 1070 card, this takes about 10â€“15 minutes to train. The images generated from the system was handed over to me from the author of the project who hand sorted the images of birds versus no birds for the training set. An image of a bird at the bird feeder is shown below.

Sample webcam image:

The problem is that a lot of false positive images come about when there are no birds, and you see images of just the sky, or just from activating the light bulb in the room.

This model is trained specifically to this birdfeeder, thus it overfits and achieves 96% accuracy to new test data of ~400 images from the same webcam and birdfeeder.
